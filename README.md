# Interactive Development Demos

A collection of interactive web development experiments and demos exploring modern UI/UX patterns, animations, and creative coding techniques.

## About This Project

This repository serves as my playground for experimenting with interactive development concepts. Each demo focuses on different aspects of web interactivity, from CSS animations to canvas-based effects, helping me explore and master various techniques used in modern web development.

The project is structured as a showcase where each demo includes:
- Live interactive demonstration
- Complete source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Syntax-highlighted code panels for easy learning
- Technology tags indicating the tools and techniques used

## Demos

### ðŸŽ¯ GSAP-Inspired Button

**Technologies:** `HTML5` `CSS3` `JavaScript` `Canvas` `Animation`

This interactive button recreates the hover effect found on the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) website. The effect features a smooth circular animation that follows the user's mouse movement across the button surface.

#### Key Features:
- **Canvas-based animation**: Uses HTML5 Canvas for smooth, high-performance rendering
- **Mouse tracking**: Real-time cursor position detection with smooth transitions
- **Responsive design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes
- **Semantic HTML**: Built with proper `<button>` element for accessibility
- **CSS custom properties**: Leverages CSS variables for consistent theming

#### Technical Implementation:
- Canvas rendering with 2D context for circle animations
- Mouse event handling for tracking cursor position relative to button bounds
- Debounced resize handling for responsive behavior
- Clean CSS reset for button element to remove default browser styles
- Modular JavaScript architecture for easy maintenance
